Please read this file and the DISCLAIMER.txt, RELEASE_LIMITATION.txt and 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.txt files before using PHaRLAP

1. Supported Matlab version of PHaRLAP
--------------------------------------
PHaRLAP is provided as a Matlab toolbox. All necessary files to run PHaRLAP in
the Matlab environment reside in the mex and src/matlab folders. Please read 
MATLAB_INSTALL_NOTES.txt for instruction on how to setup PHaRLAP to run with
Matlab. 

2. End user non-Matlab versions of PHaRLAP
------------------------------------------
The compiled libraries (MacOS, Windows and Linux versions) and the C wrappers
and makefiles used to build the Matlab mex executables are provided in the lib
and src/C folders respectively. Using the C wrappers and makefiles as examples
it should be  possible to build non-Matlab versions (e.g. Python versions) of
PHaRLAP with the supplied libraries. However, support for any non-Matlab version
of PHaRLAP will be very limited. 

Any code the has been generated by you may be freely passed on to third parties.  
However, third parties are to download PHaRLAP from the DST Group website
https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/partner-with-us/access-our-technology
and install the provided libaries before any non-Matlab version of PHaRLAP can
be used.
